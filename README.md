# Craigslist used Cars Price Prediction
I am using a Dataset, which contains Informations about used cars from Craigslist. The Dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

# Goal 
Building a model to predict the price of a used car. 


# Result
The XGboost Regressor Algorithm did best compared to other used Algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor as shown in the table below.
MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RE (Relative Error).
